<h2 id="benefits">Benefits of Vegetable Salad</h2>
<p id="benefitsParagraph">A lot of veggies have a large amount of water. This means that as you
 enjoy them, the consumption of water increases. Water helps to eliminate
 toxins from the body by the skin and urine. This makes the skin smooth and healthy.
 Take notice that impurities in the body are the 
leading cause of dull and bacterial skin infestation.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue;" id="steps">Steps to make Vegetable Salad</h2>

<ul id="stepForVegetableSalad" style="color:blue;display:inline-block;">
<li>Try adding blanched, lightly steamed or roasted veggies like broccoli, french beans, corn, cauliflower,
                baby corn.</li>
<li>Add lentils, beans or chickpeas or bean sprouts for more protein.</li>
<li>Grate some of the vegetables for a different texture.</li>
<li>Add marinated veggies like artichoke hearts for tang, or other veggies like radish for some pungency.</li>
<li>Swap in your own favorite combination of dried fruits, nuts and seeds. I added what I had at home.</li>
<li>Use fresh coriander or chives instead of parsley.</li>
<footer id="footerText" style="color: navy;margin-top: 50px;border-top:2px solid  wheat;">Salad plays a very important role in any meal. Indian food and Indian meals are incomplete without
            serving healthy salad dishes. We consume various food items on daily basis and none of them is as important
            as salad. That’s why salad is considered as a “King or Prince of the Menu”</footer>
